    <h1>About me, Robert Bernard Howell</h1>
    <h2> Short Biography</h2>
    <p>
        I was born on November 29 <sup>th</sup> 1997 in Camden, New Jersey.
        I grew up in a small town named Woodstown, in Salem county. My high school was small, my graduating class was around 250 students.
    </p>
    <p>
        At an early age I was always fascinated by machinery and technology, namely how they functioned. I would spend afternoons taking apart old clocks and radios and examining
        the circuit boards and resistors that were housed inside.
