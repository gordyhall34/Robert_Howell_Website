    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p class="bio">
        I was born on November 29 <sup>th</sup> 1997 in Camden, New Jersey.
        I grew up in a small town named Woodstown, in Salem county. My high school was small, my graduating class was around 250 students.
        <br />
        At an early age I was always fascinated by machinery and technology, namely how they functioned. I would spend afternoons taking apart old clocks and radios and examining
        the circuit boards and resistors that were housed inside.
        <br />
        I have created this website to practice my HTML coding skills and learn how to implement CSS into webpages.
